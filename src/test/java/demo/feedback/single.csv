It is visible that he sort of gets stuck and someone needs to help him get back on track.","36","We were not very often able to observe judgement or decison making.","36","","36","You are more focussed on your own domain than interested in the global context.","50","Within your domain you worked quite well. You should look beyond it.","36","","36","","57","Problem is rather to get him to become responsible for something but once committed one can rely on him. He wants to be responsible for something, and he is commited to that.","58","Receiver is able to work under pressure. Maybe he even performs better under pressure. He is motivated, and pushes himself hard to get the job done.","51","","51","Receiver likes to work with known technologies, and topics. He realized this will be a problem in his career, for this he tries to get more involved in backend programming, which he did not do as of now. He is collaborative in the ToM but could take more advantage of the ToM and be more focussed pursuing his goal.","50","","56","You are perceived as a loyal team member.","50","","36","Not expected in the team.","51","","36","In your ToM you rather waited for external impulse. After receiving this impulse your collaboration was good. Instead of only expressing desires or ambitions you should also come up with ideas how to achieve this goal and thus take more responsibility for own development.","36","You worked with known technologies for a long time in the past but later you realized that this will become a problem in the long term. You saw that the ToM offers an opportunity to address this problem and you demonstrated a good amount of cooperation here. But then you acted in our opinion too passive to achieve your goal."

I feel that you could think in more detail before you derive solutions. Often you just start and "somehow bring it to the end". Try to take some conceptual time before starting - this could also help in terms of speed.","51","","26","I observe you as a person who can improve on being more structured and organized in your daily doing. You come up with solutions, indeed, sometimes they are not the highest quality ones however.","51","","26","Again, I observe you as a person who can clearly improve on structuring topics and tasks - which lets your daily doing appear more organized.","38","I observe you as a person who could improve on bringing more speed into your daily doing.","75","I observe you as a person who has a clear strength here. When taking over tasks you reliably deliver and also act as a driver. In addition, I experienced you as someone who is always willing to go the extra mile. Keep up with this.","77","","75","I observe you as a person who is close to being "solid as a rock" under stressful situations. Your attitude and humor clearly saved some situations in the past. I really appreciate this.","54","","64","","64","","-1","","75","","52","","100","I observe you as a person who I definitely do not want to miss at work. You bring indeed a lot of fun to work (maybe a bit too much?!). However, you are the only one I gave the highest score here.
